[00:13] Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
[00:14] in a 1968 speech where he reflects
upon the Civil Rights Movement,
[00:18] states, "In the end,
[00:21] we will remember not the words of our enemies
[00:24] but the silence of our friends."
[00:27] As a teacher, I've internalized this message.
[00:29] Every day, all around us,
[00:31] we see the consequences of silence
[00:33] manifest themselves in the form of discrimination,
[00:35] violence, genocide and war.
[00:39] In the classroom, I challenge my students
[00:41] to explore the silences in their own lives
[00:44] through poetry.
[00:46] We work together to fill those spaces,
[00:48] to recognize them, to name them,
[00:51] to understand that they don't
have to be sources of shame.
[00:54] In an effort to create a culture within my classroom
[00:57] where students feel safe sharing the intimacies
[00:59] of their own silences,
[01:01] I have four core principles posted on the board
[01:03] that sits in the front of my class,
[01:05] which every student signs
at the beginning of the year:
[01:08] read critically, write consciously,
[01:10] speak clearly, tell your truth.
[01:14] And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point,
[01:16] tell your truth.
[01:18] And I realized that
[01:20] if I was going to ask my students to speak up,
[01:22] I was going to have to tell my truth
[01:25] and be honest with them about the times
[01:27] where I failed to do so.
[01:28] So I tell them that growing up,
[01:30] as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans,
[01:33] during Lent I was always taught
[01:36] that the most meaningful thing one could do
[01:38] was to give something up,
[01:39] sacrifice something you typically indulge in
[01:42] to prove to God you understand his sanctity.
[01:44] I've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries,
[01:47] French kisses, and everything in between.
[01:50] But one year, I gave up speaking.
[01:54] I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice
[01:56] was my own voice, but it was like I hadn't realized
[02:00] that I had given that up a long time ago.
[02:03] I spent so much of my life
[02:05] telling people the things they wanted to hear
[02:07] instead of the things they needed to,
[02:08] told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience
[02:11] because I still had to figure out being my own,
[02:13] so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything,
[02:16] appeasing ignorance with my silence,
[02:19] unaware that validation doesn't need words
[02:21] to endorse its existence.
[02:23] When Christian was beat up for being gay,
[02:24] I put my hands in my pocket
[02:26] and walked with my head
down as if I didn't even notice.
[02:29] I couldn't use my locker for weeks
because the bolt on the lock
[02:31] reminded me of the one I had put on my lips
[02:33] when the homeless man on the corner
[02:35] looked at me with eyes up merely searching
[02:37] for an affirmation that he was worth seeing.
[02:39] I was more concerned with
touching the screen on my Apple
[02:41] than actually feeding him one.
[02:43] When the woman at the fundraising gala
[02:44] said "I'm so proud of you.
[02:46] It must be so hard teaching
those poor, unintelligent kids,"
[02:49] I bit my lip, because apparently
we needed her money
[02:51] more than my students needed their dignity.
[02:53] We spend so much time
[02:55] listening to the things people are saying
[02:59] that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't.
[03:02] Silence is the residue of fear.
[03:06] It is feeling your flaws
[03:07] gut-wrench guillotine your tongue.
[03:09] It is the air retreating from your chest
[03:11] because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.
[03:13] Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina.
[03:16] It is what you hear when there
aren't enough body bags left.
[03:19] It is the sound after the noose is already tied.
[03:22] It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain.
[03:25] There is no time to pick your battles
[03:27] when your battles have already picked you.
[03:28] I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision.
[03:31] I will tell Christian that he is a lion,
[03:33] a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance.
[03:36] I will ask that homeless man what his name is
[03:38] and how his day was, because sometimes
[03:40] all people want to be is human.
[03:42] I will tell that woman that my students can talk about
[03:44] transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau,
[03:47] and just because you watched
one episode of "The Wire"
[03:49] doesn't mean you know anything about my kids.
[03:51] So this year,
[03:53] instead of giving something up,
[03:55] I will live every day as if there were a microphone
[03:57] tucked under my tongue,
[03:59] a stage on the underside of my inhibition.
[04:03] Because who has to have a soapbox
[04:05] when all you've ever needed is your voice?
[04:10] Thank you.
[04:12] (Applause)
