[00:02] I'm gonna talk to you about some things that I've learned in my journey
[00:05] Most from experience some of them I heard in passing
[00:08] Many of them I'm still practicing, but all of them I do believe are true
[00:17] Life is not easy. It is not. Don't try to make it that way.
[00:22] life's not fair, it never was, it isn't now and it won't ever be.
[00:25] Do not fall into the trap
[00:27] the entitlement trap
[00:29] a feeling like you're a victim
[00:31] You are not
[00:32] get over it and get on with it
[00:37] So the question that we gotta ask ourselves is what success is to us? what success is to you?
[00:44] Is it more money? That's fine? I got nothing against money
[00:47] Maybe it's a healthy family.
[00:49] Maybe it's a happy marriage. Maybe it's to help others to be famous, to be spiritually sound
[00:54] Leave the world a little bit better place than you found it
[00:59] Continue to ask yourself that question
[01:01] now your answer may change over time and that's fine
[01:04] but do yourself this favor
[01:07] Whatever your answer is don't choose anything that will jeopardize yourself
[01:14] Prioritize who you are who you want to be
[01:17] and don't spend time with anything that antagonizes your character
[01:25] Be brave take the hill, but first answer that question what's my hill?
[01:31] So first we have to define success for ourselves
[01:35] And then we have to put in the work to maintain it
[01:38] Make that daily tally
[01:39] Tend to our garden.
[01:41] keep the things that are important to us in good shape
[01:44] Where you are not is as important as where you are
[01:48] And it's just as important where we are not as it is where we are
[01:57] Look the first step that leads to our identity in life
[02:02] Is usually not
[02:04] I know who I am. I know who I am.
[02:07] that's not the first step. The first steps is usually I know who I am not.
[02:12] Process of elimination
[02:14] Defining ourselves by what we are not is the first step that leads us to really knowing who we are
[02:21] You know that group of friends that you hang out with?
[02:24] That really might not bring out the best in you?
[02:26] You know, they they gossip too much, or they kind of shady.
[02:30] They really aren't gonna be there for you in a pinch
[02:34] Or how about that bar that we keep going to, that we always seem to have the worst hangover from?
[02:41] or that computer screen
[02:42] right? the computer screen that keeps giving us an excuse not to get out of the house
[02:46] And engage with the world and get some real human interaction
[02:51] Or how about that food that would keep eating?
[02:53] stuff that taste so good going down, but makes us feel like crap the next week
[02:56] We feel lethargic we keep putting on weight
[03:00] Well, those people, those places, those things.
[03:04] Stop giving them your time and energy.
[03:06] Just don't go there. I mean put them down
[03:09] And when you do this, when you do put them down, when you quit going there
[03:13] When you quit giving them your time you inadvertently find yourself spending more time and in more places
[03:21] That are healthy for you. that bring you more joy
[03:24] Why?
[03:25] Because you've just eliminated the whos, the wheres, the whats and the whens
[03:29] that were keeping you from your identity
[03:32] Trust me too many options.
[03:34] I promise that too many options will make a tyrant of us all
[03:38] So get rid of the excess
[03:41] the wasted time
[03:42] Decrease your options
[03:45] If you do this you will have accidentally,
[03:48] Almost innocently,
[03:50] put in front of you, what is important
[03:54] By process Elimination.
[03:59] knowing who we are is hard
[04:02] It's hard
[04:03] Give yourself a break
[04:06] Eliminate who you are not first
[04:08] And you'll find yourself where you need to be
[04:14] Instead of creating outcomes to take from us,
[04:16] let's create more outcomes that pay us back
[04:19] Fill us up
[04:21] Keep your fire lit, turn you on,
[04:24] for the most amount of time in your future
[04:28] We try our best we don't always do our best
[04:32] our architecture
[04:33] Is a verb as well
[04:36] Since we are the architects of our own lives
[04:38] Let's study the habits, the practices, the routines that we have that lead to and feed our success
[04:44] our joy
[04:45] Our honest pain
[04:47] Our laughter
[04:48] Our earned tears
[04:49] let's dissect that, and give thanks for those things
[04:53] and when we do that guess what happens?
[04:55] we get better at them
[04:57] And we have more to dissect
[05:03] Be discerning
[05:04] choose it
[05:05] because you want it
[05:07] do it because you want to
[05:15] We're gonna make mistakes
[05:17] You've got to own them
[05:19] Then you got to make amends
[05:21] And then you got to move on
[05:23] guilt and regret kills many a man before their time
[05:27] So turn the page, get off the ride
[05:30] You are the author of the book of your life
