[00:00] if you want to change the world start
[00:04] off by making your bed if you make your
[00:10] bed every morning you will have
[00:12] accomplished the first task of the day
[00:14] it will give you a small sense of pride
[00:16] and it will encourage you to do another
[00:18] task and another and another and by the
[00:22] end of the day that one task completed
[00:24] will have turned into mini task
[00:26] completed making your bed will also
[00:28] reinforce the fact that the little
[00:30] things in life matter if you can't do
[00:33] the little things right you'll never be
[00:35] able to do the big things right and if
[00:37] by chance you have a miserable day you
[00:40] will come home to a bed that is made
[00:43] that you made and a made bed gives you
[00:47] encouragement that tomorrow will be
[00:48] better I've been a Navy SEAL for 36
[00:52] years
[00:52] every morning in SEAL training my
[00:55] instructors who at the time were all
[00:57] Vietnam veterans would show up in my
[00:59] barracks room and the first thing they
[01:01] do is inspect my bed if you did it right
[01:04] the corners would be square the covers
[01:06] would be pulled tight the pillows
[01:08] centered just under the headboard and
[01:10] the extra blanket folded neatly at the
[01:12] foot of the rack it was a simple task
[01:15] mundane at best but every morning we
[01:18] were required to make our bed to
[01:21] perfection it seemed a little ridiculous
[01:23] at the time particularly in light of the
[01:24] fact that we were aspiring to be real
[01:27] warriors tough battle-hardened seals
[01:30] but the wisdom of this simple act has
[01:32] been proven to me many times over
[01:37] [Music]
[01:38] it matters not whether you ever serve
[01:40] the day in uniform it matters not your
[01:42] gender your ethnic or religious
[01:44] background your orientation or your
[01:46] social status our struggles in this
[01:48] world are similar and the lessons to
[01:50] overcome those struggles and to move
[01:52] forward changing ourselves and changing
[01:55] the world around us will apply equally
[01:57] to all if you think it's hard to change
[02:02] the lives of ten people change their
[02:04] lives forever you're wrong
[02:06] I saw it happen every day in Iraq and
[02:09] Afghanistan but changing the world can
[02:11] happen anywhere and anyone can do it so
[02:15] what starts here can indeed change the
[02:16] world and you will likely fail often it
[02:20] will be painful it will be discouraging
[02:23] at times it will test you to your very
[02:25] core at that darkest moment of the
[02:33] mission is a time when you need to be
[02:35] calm when you must be calm when you must
[02:39] be composed when all your tactical
[02:42] skills your physical power and your
[02:44] inner strength must be brought to bear
[02:46] if you want to change the world you must
[02:51] be your very best in the darkest moments
[02:55] if I have learned anything in my time
[02:58] traveling the world it is the power of
[03:01] hope the power of one person the
[03:04] Washington a Lincoln King Mandela and
[03:07] even a young girl from Pakistan Malala
[03:09] one person can change the world by
[03:12] giving people hope
[03:15] start each day with a task completed
[03:17] find someone to help you through life
[03:19] respect everyone know that life is not
[03:22] fair that you will fail often but if you
[03:25] take some risks step up on the times
[03:27] you're the toughest face down the
[03:29] bullies lift up the downtrodden and
[03:31] never ever give up if you do these
[03:33] things the next generation and the
[03:37] generations that follow will live in a
[03:39] world far better than the one we have
[03:40] today and what started here will indeed
[03:44] have changed the world for the better
[03:48] finally a seal training there's a bell a
[03:51] brass bell that hangs in the center of
[03:54] the compound for all the students to see
[03:55] all you have to do to quit is ring the
[03:59] bell ring the bell and you no longer
[04:02] have to wake up at 5 o'clock ring the
[04:03] bell and you no longer have to be in the
[04:06] freezing cold swims ring the bell and
[04:09] you no longer have to do the runs the
[04:11] obstacle course the PT and you no longer
[04:14] have to endure the hardships of training
[04:17] all you have to do is ring the bell to
[04:19] get out
[04:20] [Music]
[04:25] if you want to change the world don't
[04:31] ever ever ring the bell
[04:37] [Music]
[04:44] [Music]
