if you want to change the world start off by making your bed if you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day it will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another and by the end of the day that one task completed will have turned into mini task completed making your bed will also reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter if you can't do the little things right you'll never be able to do the big things right and if by chance you have a miserable day you will come home to a bed that is made that you made and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better I've been a Navy SEAL for 36 years every morning in SEAL training my instructors who at the time were all Vietnam veterans would show up in my barracks room and the first thing they do is inspect my bed if you did it right the corners would be square the covers would be pulled tight the pillows centered just under the headboard and the extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of the rack it was a simple task mundane at best but every morning we were required to make our bed to perfection it seemed a little ridiculous at the time particularly in light of the fact that we were aspiring to be real warriors tough battle-hardened seals but the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over [Music] it matters not whether you ever serve the day in uniform it matters not your gender your ethnic or religious background your orientation or your social status our struggles in this world are similar and the lessons to overcome those struggles and to move forward changing ourselves and changing the world around us will apply equally to all if you think it's hard to change the lives of ten people change their lives forever you're wrong I saw it happen every day in Iraq and Afghanistan but changing the world can happen anywhere and anyone can do it so what starts here can indeed change the world and you will likely fail often it will be painful it will be discouraging at times it will test you to your very core at that darkest moment of the mission is a time when you need to be calm when you must be calm when you must be composed when all your tactical skills your physical power and your inner strength must be brought to bear if you want to change the world you must be your very best in the darkest moments if I have learned anything in my time traveling the world it is the power of hope the power of one person the Washington a Lincoln King Mandela and even a young girl from Pakistan Malala one person can change the world by giving people hope start each day with a task completed find someone to help you through life respect everyone know that life is not fair that you will fail often but if you take some risks step up on the times you're the toughest face down the bullies lift up the downtrodden and never ever give up if you do these things the next generation and the generations that follow will live in a world far better than the one we have today and what started here will indeed have changed the world for the better finally a seal training there's a bell a brass bell that hangs in the center of the compound for all the students to see all you have to do to quit is ring the bell ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at 5 o'clock ring the bell and you no longer have to be in the freezing cold swims ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs the obstacle course the PT and you no longer have to endure the hardships of training all you have to do is ring the bell to get out [Music] if you want to change the world don't ever ever ring the bell [Music] [Music]
