[01:53] there's a few things about three things
[01:56] to my account that I need each day one I
[02:00] miss something to look up to another is
[02:02] something to look forward to and another
[02:04] is someone to chase now first off I want
[02:10] to thank God because that's who I look
[02:12] up to
[02:13] he's graced my life with opportunities
[02:16] that I know are not of my hand or any
[02:18] other human hand he has shown me that
[02:22] it's a scientific fact that gratitude
[02:25] reciprocates in the words of a late
[02:29] Charlie Lawton who said when you got God
[02:33] you got a friend and that friend is you
[02:37] to my family that's who and what I look
[02:42] forward to to my father who I know he's
[02:44] up there right now with a big pot of
[02:46] gumbo he's got a lemon meringue pie over
[02:48] there he's probably in his underwear
[02:50] he's got a cold can of Miller Lite he's
[02:51] dancing right
[02:54] do you dad you taught me what it means
[02:57] to be a man to my mother who's here
[02:59] tonight who taught me and my two older
[03:02] brothers demanded that we respect
[03:05] ourselves and what we in turn learned
[03:07] was then we were better able to respect
[03:09] others thank you for that mama - my wife
[03:12] Camilla and my kids Levi
[03:14] Peeta mr. stone the courage and
[03:16] significance you give me every day I go
[03:18] out the door is unparalleled you are the
[03:20] four people in my life I want to make
[03:22] the most proud of me thank you
[03:26] and to my hero that's who I chase now
[03:32] when I was fifteen years old I had a
[03:34] very important person in my life come to
[03:36] me and say who's your hero and I said I
[03:37] got to think about that give me a couple
[03:38] of weeks I come back two weeks later
[03:39] this person comes out and says who's
[03:41] your hero I said I thought about it you
[03:42] know who it is I said it's me in ten
[03:44] years
[03:45] so I turned twenty five ten years later
[03:48] that same person comes Mingo so you're a
[03:50] hero and I was like not even close no no
[03:53] no she said why I said because my heroes
[03:56] me at 35 so you see every day every week
[03:58] every month and every year of my life my
[04:01] heroes always ten years away
[04:03] I'm never gonna be my hero I'm not gonna
[04:05] attain that I know I'm not and that's
[04:07] just fine with me because that keeps me
[04:08] with somebody to keep on chasing so to
[04:12] any of us whatever those things are
[04:14] whatever it is we look up to whatever it
[04:16] is we look forward to and whoever it is
[04:18] we're chasing to that I say amen to that
